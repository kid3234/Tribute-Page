        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p class="bio">Tsegaye Gabre-Medhin, a prominent Ethiopian playwright and poet, was born in Bodaa village near Addis Ababa.
            He wrote plays from a young age and later studied theater in Europe. Gabre-Medhin played a significant role
            in managing the Ethiopian National Theater and received accolades,
            including the Haile Selassie I Prize for Amharic Literature. His works celebrated Ethiopia's history and
            cultural heritage, with plays like "Tewodros" and "Petros at the Hour" gaining international recognition.
            Gabre-Medhin also translated and directed works by Shakespeare, Moli√®re, and Brecht. Despite residing in
            Manhattan for medical treatment, he remained connected to the Ethiopian diaspora. He passed away in 2006 and
            was buried in Addis Ababa.</p>
